Part 1: Configuring your GitHub account
The first steps in starting with GitHub are to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, set up two-factor authentication, and view your profile.

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and represents you as an individual.

1. Creating an account
To sign up for an account, navigate to https://github.com/ and follow the prompts.

To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a strong and unique password. For more information, see "Creating a strong password."
